This is a collection of projects I made when I was 10-13 years old.

* **Virtual IIgs (11/2/2009):** An interface for the [ActiveGS](http://activegs.freetoolsassociation.com/) browser plugin. Needs the ActiveGS plugin to function.
* **Virtual II (11/4/2009):** An interface for the [AppleIIGo](http://code.google.com/p/appleiigo/) Apple II Java emulator. Includes pre-configured ProDOS and Contiki machines.
* **iHTML (2/3/2010):** A JavaScript HTML editor with a built-in preview tool. Probably the most functional project in The Vault.
* **iStickman (2/20/2010):** Experiment with Adobe Flash, click the stick guy to make him do stuff. Animated with Flipnote Studio for the Nintendo DSi.
* **iPad Simulator X (4/12/2010):** Web app that mimics Apple's iPad Simulator.
* **iMobile Simulator (5/30/2010):** Web app that simulates an early version of Android. The latest version of Android when this was made was Android 2.2, so I assume I made it based on that.
* **iPhone Simulator (6/7/2010):** Web app that mimics Apple's iPhone Simulator in the Xcode SDK.
* **iCrash (9/1/2010):** Web app that crashes Internet Explorer 6 or 7, by using faulty form code.
* **iPhone Simulator X (9/15/2010):** Improved version of the iPhone Simulator.
* **Minecraft Skin Finder v2 (11/25/2011):** Preview, download, and edit Minecraft skins. A [forked version named 'SkinViewer'](https://github.com/Atnode/Minecraft-SkinViewer) is still under development.
