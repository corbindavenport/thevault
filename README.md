The Vault
========

The Vault is a collection of my abandoned/not working projects that I have made over the years. These range from small experiments with Flash Player to more advanced projects like an HTML editor.

All of these projects are discontinued, and most of them never saw the light of day in the first place. Many of them have code errors, glitches, syntax errors, major bugs, etc. Don't expect much use from them, they are in The Vault for a reason ;)

The Projects
========
* iPhone Simulator - a web application that mimics Apple's iPhone Simulator in the Xcode SDK.
* iPhone Simulator X - an improved version of iPhone Simulator
* iPad Simulator - a web application that mimics Apple's iPad Simulator in the Xcode SDK.
* iPad Simulator X - an improved version of the iPad Simulator.
* iHTML - A JavaScript HTML editor with a built-in preview tool. Probably the most functional project in The Vault.
* iCrash - A simple web application that crashes Internet Explorer 6 or 7, by using faulty form code.
