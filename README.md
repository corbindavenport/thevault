The Vault
========

The Vault is a collection of my abandoned/not working projects that I have made over the years. These range from small experiments with Flash Player to more advanced projects like an HTML editor.

All of these projects are discontinued, and most of them never saw the light of day in the first place. Many of them have code errors, glitches, syntax errors, major bugs, etc. Don't expect much use from them, they are in The Vault for a reason ;)

All of these are open source under the GPLv3 license.

The Projects
=======
* **Virtual IIgs (11/2/2009)** - An interface for the [ActiveGS](http://activegs.freetoolsassociation.com/) browser plugin. Needs the ActiveGS plugin to function.
* **Virtual II (11/4/2009)** - An interface for the [AppleIIGo](http://code.google.com/p/appleiigo/) Apple II Java emulator. Includes pre-configured ProDOS and Contiki machines.
* **iHTML (2/3/2010)** - A JavaScript HTML editor with a built-in preview tool. Probably the most functional project in The Vault.
* **iStickman (2/20/2010)** - Experiment with Adobe Flash, click the stick guy to make him do stuff. Animated with Flipnote Studio for the Nintendo DSi.
* **iPad Simulator X (4/12/2010)** - a web application that mimics Apple's iPad Simulator.
* **iMobile Simulator (5/30/2010)** - a simulator of an early version of Android with a web browser. The latest version of Android when this was made was Android 2.2, so I assume I made it based on that.
* **iPhone Simulator (6/7/2010)** - a web application that mimics Apple's iPhone Simulator in the Xcode SDK.
* **iCrash (9/1/2010)** - A simple web application that crashes Internet Explorer 6 or 7, by using faulty form code.
* **iPhone Simulator X (9/15/2010)** - an improved version of iPhone Simulator
* **Minecraft Skin Finder v2 (11/25/2011)** - Allows you to preview, download, and edit Minecraft skins.
